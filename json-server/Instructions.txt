To start the json-server, in the json-server folder execute the following command:

json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000 -H ip_address

(replace ip_address with the ip address which will be displayed when you run npm start and the tunnel is ready)
* this ip address will change when you are connected to different network, so
if no data is shown in the App, check this ip address.
